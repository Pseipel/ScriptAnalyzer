				<!--<p class="text-justify">Lyra is an open lyrics analyzer tool.
					After you uploaded your Excel file you can analyze the given data
					in different ways. You got a searchsection that allows you to
					search for terms or phrases in your lyrics, song titles, artist
					names and so on. Another section is the map area. Here you will see
					all the places mentioned in the lyrics and the biographical dates
					of the different artists you entered in your data table. All these
					places are detected and localized automatically.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">In the last area you can find tools
					concerning the weighted word frequencies. So you can either compare
					the important terms used by an artist with those of another artist
					or compare phases of one artist.

				<p>Welcome to lyra, a lyrics-analyzer with machine learning
					tools that helps you to get an overview of lyrics.</p>
				<p>What does lyra give?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>browsing through your corpus (Browse)</li>
					<li>place name detection in lyrics</li>
					<li>visualization on a map (Places)</li>
					<li>detection of relevant words in your corpus (Frequencies)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If the current corpus is empty or if you want to add lyrics to the existing
				corpus you can do it with the following instructions.</p>
				<p>What does lyra need?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>your corpus in form of an .xslx-File</li>
					<li>biographical information on the artists you want to
						analyze</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					You can download a empty sample of the table <a href="">here</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the table, each row represents a different song.<br /> The
					artist column can contain as many different artists as you want to
					analyze. Instead of the artist, it can contain the song writer if
					you want to analyze this information.<br /> The title column
					contains - of course - the title of the song.<br /> The year
					column may contain the year when the song was released. It may
					contain as well the year the song was produced or it was written
					and so on. That's up to you.<br /> In the compilation column you
					can mark (with an "x") whether the song is part of a compilation or
					not.<br /> The lyrics column contains the lyrics you want to
					analyze. For using the analytic tools it is important that the
					lyrics (by now) are written in English language<br /> The comment
					column leaves space for you to add some comments for yourself.
